        <p>Comment By LaBaDa 5.Dez, 2012:
            <cite>For something to truly be art, it must serve no other purpose than to be viewed,
                experienced, taken in.
                This is not just another platform flash game, this is art that can be experienced
                through the medium of programming. Deep insights on what love can be,
                but who am I to try to say what they are? Rather than that,
                I simply defend this work as what It is: art.
                There is no purpose to this game than story, that is why the game-play moves slowly,
                the platforming isn't pulse pounding or even,honestly, well made, and why you are expected to
                fill in the gaps left out of the story. I give it a 5/5, as I can see that a
                intricate thought process was put into this as a whole. My only advice to those
                who don't like it: play the 1st, take more than five minutes out of your schedule
                of wasting time on other games (Not to say that your time spent here is any more meaningful),
                and use that amazing gray matter we all have to enjoy this one. Thanks NoFateNet,
                that was a lovely way to spend a few minutes.</cite></p>
        <p> Since Adobe Flash is no longer supported by the web, the game can no longer be viewed on a website. But I
            can offer a Standalone Version to <a href="res/Closed_In_Addendum.zip">DOWNLOAD</a> [4.3mb][WIN executable only] </p>
        
        <p> Try running the game online with remote Ruffle <a href="/play/play_closed_in_addendum.html">HERE</a></p>
